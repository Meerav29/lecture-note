<!-- # Getting Started with Lecture Note

## 🎉 Congratulations!

Your Lecture Note platform has been completely redesigned and is now a **full-featured SaaS application** with:

*   ✅ User authentication
*   ✅ Persistent database storage
*   ✅ Audio recording with live waveform
*   ✅ Automatic transcription
*   ✅ AI-powered content generation
*   ✅ Chat interface
*   ✅ Beautiful, intuitive UI -->

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase

Follow the complete instructions in [**SUPABASE\_SETUP.md**](SUPABASE_SETUP.md)

Quick checklist:

1.  Create Supabase project
2.  Get API keys (URL, anon key, service role key)
3.  Run the database schema (`lib/supabase/schema.sql`)
4.  Create storage bucket (`lecture-audio`)
5.  Set up storage policies

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# AI APIs (existing)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your-deepgram-key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-claude-key"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Flow:
Homepage → Sign Up → Dashboard → [Record/Upload] → Lecture View
                         ↑                            ↓
                         └────────[Back]──────────────┘

Data Flow:
Audio → Supabase Storage
      → Deepgram API (transcription)
      → Database (lectures table)
      → AI APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic)
      → Database (lecture_content table)
```

## 📊 Database Structure

### Tables

*   **lectures** - Lecture metadata, transcripts
*   **lecture\_content** - Generated content (notes, flashcards, etc.)
*   **lecture\_chats** - Chat message history

### Storage

*   **lecture-audio** bucket - Audio files

All protected with Row Level Security (RLS)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
*   **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
*   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **Auth**: Supabase Auth
*   **Storage**: Supabase Storage
*   **Transcription**: Deepgram
*   **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 & Anthropic Claude
*   **Styling**: CSS custom properties (dark/light theme)

## 🎨 UI Highlights

*   **Clean Dashboard** - Grid layout, search, quick actions
*   **Live Waveform** - Real-time visualization while recording
*   **Flip Cards** - 3D CSS animation for flashcards
*   **Auto-scroll Chat** - Messages auto-scroll to bottom
*   **Progress Indicators** - Upload/transcription progress
*   **Dark/Light Theme** - Built-in theme toggle
*   **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes

## ⚡ Performance

*   **Lazy Loading** - Components load as needed
*   **Optimistic UI** - Instant feedback
*   **Debounced Auto-save** - Reduces API calls
*   **Cached Queries** - Faster data fetching

## 🔒 Security

*   **RLS Policies** - Users can only see their own data
*   **Protected Routes** - Middleware redirects unauthorized users
*   **Environment Variables** - API keys never exposed to client
*   **HTTPS Only** - Enforced by Supabase

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch session"

*   Check environment variables are set correctly
*   Restart dev server after adding env vars

### "Transcription failed"

*   Verify DEEPGRAM\_API\_KEY is valid
*   Check audio file is valid format
*   Look at server console for detailed error

### "Generation failed"

*   Verify OPENAI\_API\_KEY or CLAUDE\_API\_KEY
*   Check API rate limits
*   Try the other provider

### "Storage error"

*   Ensure storage bucket created
*   Verify storage policies are set up
*   Check file permissions

### Build errors mentioning Supabase

*   Normal if env vars not set
*   Will work fine in development with vars
*   Set all required vars before deploying

## 📝 Development Tips

### Run in Dev Mode

```
npm run dev
